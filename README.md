<h1>Machine Learning for Heart Disease Prediction</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
This repository contains resources and examples for using machine learning algorithms to predict heart disease. Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and machine learning models can aid in early detection and risk assessment, potentially saving lives through timely interventions.

<h2>Dataset</h2>
The dataset used in this project is the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bharath011/heart-disease-classification-dataset/data" target="_blank">Heart Disease Dataset</a> from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The size of the dataset is 1319 samples, which have nine fields, where eight fields are for input fields and one field for an output field. Age, gender(0 for Female, 1 for Male) ,heart rate (impulse), systolic BP (pressurehight), diastolic BP (pressurelow), blood sugar(glucose), CK-MB (kcm), and Test-Troponin (troponin) are representing the input fields, while the output field pertains to the presence of heart attack (class), which is divided into two categories (negative and positive); negative refers to the absence of a heart attack, while positive refers to the presence of a heart attack.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

- Install Dependencies: Make sure you have Python installed on your system along with libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn.
* Data Preprocessing: Load the dataset, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and perform feature scaling if necessary.
+ Model Selection: Choose one or more machine learning algorithms to train on the dataset. Experiment with different algorithms to see which one performs best for your specific task.
- Training: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train the selected models on the training data.
* Evaluation: Evaluate the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC).
+ Deployment: Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it in a real-world setting for heart disease prediction.

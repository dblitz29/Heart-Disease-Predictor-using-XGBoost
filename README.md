Welcome to the Heart Disease Predictor repository! This project leverages the power of XGBoost and machine learning to predict the risk of heart disease.

## 📊 Project Overview

Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. This project aims to provide an early warning system using machine learning models to predict heart disease based on various health indicators.

## 🗂 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes 1319 patient records with attributes such as:

- **Age**: Patient's age
- **Gender**: Male or Female
- **Heart Rate**: Beats per minute
- **Blood Pressure**: Systolic blood pressure
- **Blood Sugar**: Blood sugar levels

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data analysis and model building.

## 🔧 Project Structure

- `notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `Heart Attack.csv`: The dataset file.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## 📈 Model Building

Various machine learning algorithms were explored, with XGBoost providing the best performance. The process includes:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Selecting and transforming features.
3. **Model Training**: Training XGBoost and other models.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall.

## 🎯 Goals

The ultimate goal is to develop a reliable predictive model that can be deployed in healthcare settings to assist clinicians in early detection and intervention of heart disease.
